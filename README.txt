This is a school project made by 4 students. The music subscription app lets you send data to a server on the same device as the client or an external one with an open 1258 port.
When you connect to a server you can complete the form and send it securely via SSL to the server. There is also a console on the right side
where you can input commands and communicate with the server.
List of commands:
